# Network Security Project Report

Execution environment: macOS Catalina (Version 10.15.5)

Programming language: Python3 (Version 3.7.4)



## Task 1

​		In this task, I implement the textbook RSA algorithm. There are two python files, namely `main.py` and `SimpleRSA.py`. The first file is a tester for the implemented RSA class in the second file. In the first file, RSA class generate a pair of 1024-bit RSA keys. Encrypt the plain text with the public key and decrypt the encrypted text with the secret key. Here is a result of executing `main.py`.

​		To run the code and get a similar result, type this command in a shell:

​		` $ python3 main.py`
